# SimplifyCompiler
final project for computer programming principles

•	Implement a scanner for lexical analysis (identifying lexical structures like key words, integer and so on).
•	Write a parser for the subset of Lua grammar, and it translates a sequence of tokens get from scanner to an abstract syntax tree (it represents the structure of statements).
•	Implement a recursive interpreter to handle a subset of Lua language, translates the syntax tree to an intermediate form which will be executed then. And test all the code using JUnit framework.
